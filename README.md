# Build Your Car
This is a single-page application that follows common design patterns, persists user data, and consumes data from APIs. Created at the end of JS course with General Assembly as a graduation project. 

## How it works?
It updates a car image dynamically, based on your preferences, and it updates the total price based on features you are addding to your car.
